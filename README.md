# holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction
This project focuses on two key aspects of software development: debugging and automation. We learn how to leverage ChatGPT's capabilities to not only identify and resolve errors more efficiently, but also to automate repetitive coding tasks.

Objectives

•    Debugging: Understand the practical use of AI to identify and resolve coding errors. I used ChatGPT to diagnose and fix bugs in sample code provided in several programming languages.

•    Automation: Learn how to automate monotonous and repetitive coding tasks with the help of ChatGPT.
